abstract: >-
  ApacheLogs2MySQL includes two Python files, one SQL file
  and one ENV file. Python module 'logs2mysql.py' handles
  file processing and execution of MySQL LOAD DATA
  statements, stored procedures and SQL statements. Python module
  'watch4logs.py' imports module 'logs2mysql.py' and
  watches Apache log folders for new files. When new files
  are created in folders module calls
  logs2mysql.processLogs() function. SQL file
  'apache_logs_schema.sql' contains Data Definition Language (DDL)
  that creates a MySQL Schema named 'apache_logs' with tables,
  views, stored functions and procedures designed to automate 
  importing Apache Access & Error Log files into a normalized 
  database for reporting & data analysis. ENV file contains 
  all environment variables required to execute Python modules.
