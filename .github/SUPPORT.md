# Support requests are best submitted via **GitHub Issues** and will be addressed ASAP!

## Please include Apache Logformat if it is a missing or malformed data issue.

### I will reply within an hour if in office. My office hours are 'almost always' unless I am asleep which is about every 24 to 48 hours for 6 to 8 hours. I rarely leave the farm so if I do not reply within an hour I am outside feeding cows or fixing something.

### I am designer, developer and support staff all in one with vast knowledge of Apache, MySQL and Python capiable of fixing any issue with application.

### Notice: this is my first Open-Source Release and a new Crash Coursed, Self-Taught GitHub.com repository user.
Please forgive me if I do not have all the GitHub components correct or proper Open-Source etiquette yet.
