Any organizations, people or person with multiple Apache servers that find this application to be a godsend in log collection financial contributions are greatly appreciated.

### The Repository's ***- Sponsor this project -*** lists three methods to make financial contributions.

There's not alot of code in the final version but I have 850 hours of research, design, iteration & development into application working long hours, around the clock since September. 

It is way more time then I intended to invest into this project and another project did get put on the back burner but it did produce my first open-source software!

This started as a need for simple solution to import Apache logs into MySQL on a project I volunteered for. Did research other open source solutions before starting. There are many out there that parse log files but none that normalized the parsed log data into a database. 

I incorporated this application into all VPS applications I oversee 4 weeks ago and have been making improvements ever since. This version fixes all the major issues encountered.

That's how my need, lack of a viable solution and rescheduling came together just right to allow me to dive deep into this project.

Any contribution made will be reflected in additional repository development projects, feeding cows :cow: and fixing :wrench: farm equipment :tractor: .

If there is enough interest & financial contributions I'll create a repository for a complete Node.js application to access the apache_logs schema.
