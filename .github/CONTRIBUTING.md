To contribute Apache Access or Log formats commonly used that the application is not setup to do please email farmfreshsoftware@gmail.com
with subject <sup>Additional Import Formats</sup> and I'll consider incorporating the format into import process of next release.

To contribute ideas or comments email farmfreshsoftware@gmail.com with subject <sup>ideas or comments</sup> and I'll be sure to reply.

Any organizations, people or person with lots of Apache servers that finds this to be a godsend in log collection financial contributions are greatly appreciated.

This Repository's ***- Sponsor this project -*** lists three methods to make financial contributions.

Winter :snowflake: is coming and there is no money in raising cattle! :cow: :cow:
 
Plus I've got to rebuild the hydrualic cylinder on my tractor's loader :tractor: as soon as I release this application in order to feed those cows. Tomorrow and Wednesday temperatures are to be high sixies. My last chance to work outside comfortably on my tractor. This release has got to happen today!

There's not alot of code in the final version but I have about 650 hours of research, design, iteration & development into this application working long hours, around the clock since September. 

This project started out by looking for a simple solution to import my Apache logs into MySQL. The more I researched existing solutions the more I realized none of them normalized the data. At least not as an open source solution. 

That's how my need, lack of a viable solution and timing came together just right to allow me to dive deep into this project. Timing Is Everything!

### “Timing, degree and conviction are the three wise men in this life.” — Robert I. Fitzhenry

This is way more time then I intended put into this project. Another project got put on the back burner but it did produce my first open-source software!

Any contribution made will be reflected in additional repository development projects, feeding cows and fixing of my tractor.

If there is enough interest & financial contributions I'll create a repository for a complete Node.js application to access the apache_logs schema.

If you have a Data Process Project and need help email farmfreshsoftware@gmail.com with subject <sup>data consultant</sup> and I'll be sure to reply.

Data processes like this is what I've been building for 30 years. :information_desk_person:
