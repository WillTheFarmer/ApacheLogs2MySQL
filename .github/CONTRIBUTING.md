To contribute Apache Access or Log formats commonly used that application is not setup for please email farmfreshsoftware@gmail.com with subject <sup>Additional Import Formats</sup> and I'll consider incorporating the format.

To contribute ideas or comments email farmfreshsoftware@gmail.com with subject <sup>ideas or comments</sup> and I'll be sure to reply.

Any organizations, people or person with multiple Apache servers that find application to be a godsend in log collection financial contributions are greatly appreciated.

There's not alot of code in the final version but I have 850 plus hours of research, design, iteration & development into application. During October I worked long hours around the clock on this. It is way more time then I intended to invest into this project and another project did get put on the back burner but it did produce my first open-source software.

I volunteer for a nonprofit organization that needed a simple solution to import Apache logs into MySQL. The Executive Director loves MySQL. First I installed the Apache log_sql_mysql modules which did create a single MySQL mostly empty table of the access log with no control or customization and many other issues. Next I researched available Apache logging solutions including GoAccess, Logstach, Apache Viewer, DataDog and others as well as CrowdStrike and Soloarwinds Loggly. I also reviewed several simple log file parsers but none normalized the parsed log data into a MySQL database. After all my investigating I decided to write a simple solution which snowballed into this complete solution.

That's how volunteering, lack of a viable MySQL solution and a flexible schedule came together just right to allow me to dive deep into this project.

November I spent incorporating the application into VPS websites and applications I oversee while making improvements along the way. Version 2.0.0 fixes all the major issues encountered and is the application baseline.

Any contributions made will be reflected in additional repository development projects, feeding cows :cow: and fixing :wrench: farm equipment :tractor:.
