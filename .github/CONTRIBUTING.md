To contribute Apache Access or Log formats commonly used that the application is not setup to do please email farmfreshsoftware@gmail.com with subject <sup>Additional Import Formats</sup> and I'll consider incorporating the format into import process.

To contribute ideas or comments email farmfreshsoftware@gmail.com with subject <sup>ideas or comments</sup> and I'll be sure to reply.

Any organizations, people or person with multiple Apache servers that find this application to be a godsend in log collection financial contributions are greatly appreciated.

There's not alot of code in the final version but I have 850 and counting hours of research, design, iteration & development into application. September and October working crazy long hours around the clock. 

It is way more time then I intended to invest into this project and another project did get put on the back burner but it did produce my first open-source software.

I volunteer for a nonprofit organization that needed a simple solution to import Apache logs into MySQL. Before starting I researched other open source solutions. There are several that parse log files but none that normalized the parsed log data into a MySQL database. The simple solution snowballed into this complete solution. 

4 weeks ago I began incorporating this into all VPS websites and applications I oversee while making apacheLogs2MySQL improvements along the way. Version 2.0.0 fixes all the major issues encountered and is the application baseline.

That's how a simple need, lack of a viable solution and rescheduling came together just right to allow me to dive deep into this project.
