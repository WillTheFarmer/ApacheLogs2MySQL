Any organizations, people or person with multiple Apache servers that find this application to be a godsend in log collection financial contributions are greatly appreciated.

### The Repository's ***- Sponsor this project -*** lists three methods to make financial contributions.

There's not alot of code in the final version but I have 650 hours of research, design, iteration & development into this application working long hours, around the clock since September.

It is way more time then I intended to invest into this project and another project did get put on the back burner but it did produce my first open-source software!

This project started out as a need for a simple solution to import Apache logs into MySQL. The more I researched existing solutions the more I realized most of them sucked and none of them normalized the data. At least not as an open source solution.

That's how my need, lack of a viable solution and rescheduling came together just right to allow me to dive deep into this project.

Any contribution made will be reflected in additional repository development projects, feeding cows and fixing farm equipment.

If there is enough interest & financial contributions I'll create a repository for a complete Node.js application to access the apache_logs schema.

Database and Data Process Projects in need of help email farmfreshsoftware@gmail.com with subject <sup>data consultant</sup> and I'll be sure to reply.

Data processes like this is what I've been building for 30 years. :information_desk_person:
