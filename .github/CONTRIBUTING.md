To contribute Apache Access or Log formats commonly used that the application is not setup to do please email farmfreshsoftware@gmail.com
with subject <sup>Additional Import Formats</sup> and I'll incorporate the format into import process of next release. 

To contribute ideas, code or comments email farmfreshsoftware@gmail.com with subject <sup>contributing</sup> and I'll be sure to reply.

Any organizations, people or person with lots of Apache servers that finds this to be a godsend in log collection financial contributions are greatly appreciated.

This Repository's ***- Sponsor this project -*** lists three methods to make financial contributions.

Winter :snowflake: is coming and there is no money in raising cattle! :cow: :cow:
 
Plus I've got to rebuild the hydrualic cylinder on my tractor's loader :tractor: as soon as I release this application in order to feed those cows.

If you have a Data Process Project and require an expert email farmfreshsoftware@gmail.com with subject <sup>data hired gun</sup> and I'll be sure to reply.

Any contribution made will be reflected in feeding cows, fixing tractor and additional repository development projects I am currently working. 
If there is enough interest & financial contributions I'll create a repository for a complete Node.js application to access the apache_logs schema.

Data processes like this is what I've been building for 30 years. :information_desk_person:
