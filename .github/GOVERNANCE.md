30 years experience in database design & object-oriented application development. I have created data applications for Insider Trading compliance, ETL processes, data warehouses, GTIN barcodes, union labor, cost accounting, warehouse management, equipment tracking and inventory control with WebSocket, HTTPS, SFTP, email, PDF and Office Automation integration.

10 years experience in 'Oracle Applications' Integration developing custom Manufacturing Tooling & Tool Inventory, Item Specifications, Activities and Documents, Production Scheduling and QC/QA applications that incorporate data from Oracle schemas BOM, INV, WIP, ONT, PO, APPLSYS, APPS, HR, AP, AR, GL & JTF.

My degree is in Mechancial Engineering and before my software career I worked for Ahlstrom Kamyr Inc. as a field engineer building pulp and paper mills in 5 States and 2 Providences in Canada. My responsibilities were fulfillment of contract specifications, project schedule, procurement and logistics of equipment.

Construction projects are a complex series of activities requiring a wide variety of highly specialized materials, many of which are custom-built for the specific job. This project management position required tracking and scheduling and I started using dBase III which was already installed on field office computer. That was the beginning of my software career.

From 1997 until 2010 I lived on the Upper Eastside and consulted in Manhattan & Brooklyn for a variety of financial, educational, manufacturing and real estate organizations.

Now I live on a 100 acre farm in the beautiful Adirondack Region of Upstate New York raising cows and building applications.

Better software is built on a farm!

High-performance, Intuitive, Data-centric Cloud and Web-based database applications is our focus.
In 1993 I formed a software consulting company - Black Diamond Software and the Summer of 1996 I began the creation of a product called "Info Digger" developed with Microsoft Visual FoxPro 5.0 which is an object-oriented programming langauge with a powerful data engine.

From 1998 to 2016 I built & still support custom business applications for clients using "Info Digger" as an application framework which I was constantly improving non-stop until Visual FoxPro 9.0.

In March 2007, Microsoft announced that there would be no VFP 10, thus making VFP9 (released to manufacturing on December 17, 2004) the last commercial VFP release from Microsoft. Service Pack 2 for Microsoft Visual FoxPro 9.0 was released on October 16, 2007. The support of Version 9 ended on January 13, 2015. For years after there were rumors Microsoft was going to continue with a version 10 and I hoped for that.

20 years of my life invested into the development of "Info Digger" which was now obsolete and I was not sure how to proceed. I needed to suck it up, regroup and focus on Web development rather than client/server development.

January 1, 2016 I decided I was done with Microsoft and installed Ubuntu as a dual boot on my Windows workstation. I was an expert in SQL, had done a fair share of development in Java, JavaScript and Python for projects in Manhattan, an expert in Oracle and MySQL with a pretty good understanding of Apache HTTP server.

I spent next 2 years evaulating the latest & greatest web technologies, building several prototypes and eventually assembling all the right components for applications I build.

"Info Digger" has been rewritten as a JavaScript ES6 module running in browser consisting of HTML5, CSS, Document Object Model (DOM) & JavaScript front-tier, a JavaScript ES6 Express module running in Node.js incorporating REST, AJAX and JSON with abstract data classes middle-tier to access both MySQL and Oracle databases.
